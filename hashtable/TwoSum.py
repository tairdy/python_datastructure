# Problem:
# Given an array of integers nums and a target integer target, find the indices of two numbers in the array that add up to the target.
# The main challenge here is to implement this function in one pass through the array. This means you should not iterate over the array more than once. Therefore, your solution should have a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in nums.
